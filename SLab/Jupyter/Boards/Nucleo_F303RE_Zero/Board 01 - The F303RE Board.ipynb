    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hardware board** is the basic instrument in the SLab Python project. It shall include, at least, two **DACs** and four **ADCs**. A **Digital to Analog Converter** (DAC) is a device that, given an input digital number, can generate a voltage output proportional to this number. An **Analog to Digital Converter** (ADC) is a device that, given a voltage in its input, measures it and returns a digital number that is proportional to the measured voltage. So, if we have a circuit to test, we can force two voltages using the two DACs and we can measure up to four node voltages using the four ADCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board communicates with a PC using a **serial COM link**. Classic serial RS-232 links are not implemented in most modern PCs, so the serial connection is usually implemented inside an **USB** link. The board is usually powered by the PC so no external power supplies are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any programmable microcontroller board that features a COM link, and, at least, two DACs and four ADCs, can be used as the hardware board if it is programmed with the proper firmware. An Arduino UNO board won't do, for instance, because although it features several ADCs, it doesn't include any DAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board firmware basically waits for a command request from the PC. When a command is received it interacts with the ADCs and DACs depending on the request. On some requests, information is brought back to the PC when the command ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we will use the [STM32 Nucleo64 F303RE](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html) demonstration board, shown in the figure below, as the hardware board. As the full name is too long, we will call it the **F303RE Board** in the rest of this document. \n",
    "\n",
    "![NucleoF303RE Board](images\\Board_01\\F303RE.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **official** SLab hardware board in the sense that a firmware is provided for it. **SLab** does not have any relationship with **ST**. We just use their board and provide a firmware. Consult the [SLab Board Folder](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Boards) for up to date information of any other officially supported boards.  \n",
    "As the communicatuion protocol is documented, you are free to use any non official board but, in this case, writing the firmware is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [F303RE Board](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html) is a microcontroller board that [ST](http://www.st.com/) provides as a way to demonstrate one of their ARM Cortex 32 bit microcontrollers, the [STM32F303RE](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32f3-series/stm32f303/stm32f303re.html). This microcontroller is quite interesting because is part of the [STM32F3](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f3-series.html?querycriteria=productId=SS1576) fammily. Microcontrollers on this familly feature a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 core (with FPU and DSP instructions) running at 72 MHz. The core is surrounded with a lot of peripherals some of them specifically designed for analog processing. The interesting peripherals respect to the **SLab** systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Up to four independent 12bit ADCs with 5 MSPS (Million Samples Per Second) capability\n",
    "* Up to three 12bit DACs (some with analog drivers)\n",
    "* Up to four embedded Operational Amplifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The ST manufacturer produces the Nucleo Board and sells them practically at cost price to promote their microcontrollers. ST produces, also, the Discovery series of boards that usually include a microcontroller and some peripherals. There are other families of boards produced by ST, but the Nucleo and Discovery series are the cheapest ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three series of Nucleo boards, the Nucleo 32 , Nucleo 64 and Nucleo 144 that feature 32 pin, 64 in or 144 pin microcontrollers. The **F303RE board** is one the the intermediate 64 pin ones. All the Nucleo boards are [MBED](https://www.mbed.com/en/) enabled. That means that they all are programmable using a web based MBED compiler at its [developer site](https://developer.mbed.org/). So you don't need to install any toolchain to program a Nucleo board. In fact, the first versions of the SLab firmware were compiled using MBED. The current version of the **F303RE Board** firmware has been developed on [ChibiOS/RT](http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php), however."

    "## Some board details\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hardware Board** is the board that interfaces both with the host PC and the circuit we want to measure. This board need to have, at least, one USB connector with a **serial over USB** link for communication with the host PC, two [DAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter) outputs and four [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any boad that satify the previous requirements can be used as a **SLab Hardware Board** as long as it includes the needed **Firmware** to communicate with the PC. Although there are plans to suppor other boards, currently the best supported board is the [STM32F303RE Nucleo64 board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303re.html). This is the board provided as part of the **SLab Kit**. You can see an image of the board below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Board Elements](images/Board_01/board_elements.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will describe the most important elements on the board, respect to the SLab usage. If at some point you don't understand the explanations, don't worry, you don't need to know all about the board internals to use it. First thing is the connection to the **host PC**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **mini USB** connector, inside the pale blue box on the image, to connect to the host PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board features **LEDs**, shown iside the three red boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A communication bicolor red/green **LD1** LED on the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An user green **LD2** LED on the center right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A power red **LD3** LED on the center left.\n",
    "\n",
    "The communication **LD1** LED is a bicolor led that indicates the state of the debug link with the host PC. In normal operation it will light in **red** color. During the firmware upload operation it will link. It will only shine in solid **green** color after uploading a new firmware and until the next power-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LD2** LED is the user LED. Unfortunatelly the user LED is connected to the same microcontroller line of the **second DAC** output. That limits the **DAC** performance. From an user point of view, if you see light on this LED, that means that the **DAC2** output quatlity is starting to degrade. There is a documented method to remove this LED connection and access the full performance of **DAC2** but it requires some SMD desoldering.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you receive the **SLab Kit** it is possible for the board to come with a yellow sticker that contains a number or a number followed by an **\"X\"** letter. If your board contains this sticker and it includes the **\"X\"** letter, it means that the **DAC2** has been disconnected from the **LD2** LED as described in [this document](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Boards/Nucleo_F303RE_Zero/Board%2003%20-%20DAC2%20Improvement.ipynb). This means that **DAC2** will have improved operation but it also means that the user **LD2** cannot be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red **LD3** LED is the power LED. In indicates when the main CPU is powered. It should lit whenever the board is connected to a host PC. The board supports power negotiation with the PC. If the PC is not able to provide the power the board needs, this LED will turn off and the **SLab System** will be non operational.  \n",
    "It is interesting to note that the power **LD3** LED is connected to the internal $5V$ board supply rail that comes from the USB cable. This supply goes through a $3.3V$ LD39050 regulator before reaching the main MCU power rails. If you shortcircuit the breadboard power rails, no harm will be made to the board or the USB connection and, in fact, the **LD3** will continue to light-up as the $5V$ rail is unaffected when the $3.3V$ rail is shorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two big two column male **ST morpho** connectors, shown inside the yellow rectangles, on the sides of the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connector **CN7** on the left side\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connector **CN10** on the right side\n",
    "\n",
    "Those connectors give access to all the MCU pins and are used to interface with the circuit we will measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two buttons in the board, shown inside the green rectangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blue **User** button that implements the **Halt** function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Black **Reset** button to rese the board\n",
    "\n",
    "The user button implements the firmware **Halt** function, when you press this button the firmware stopts watever it is doing, returns an error code, and waits for new commands. This function is interesting if you, by mistake, send a too long to complete command to the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reset** button gives access to the main MCU reset line. If you press this button the MCU will reset and you will need to reconnect to the board. This button is useffull if the board hangs-up and is not recoverable by the **Halt** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To end this board description we have three jumper locations on the board, shown inside the orange boxes in the image. From top to bottom of the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CN2** ST-Link pair of jumpers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JP5** power selection jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JP6** $I_{DD}$ measurement jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "Jumpers are important because they are detachable from the board and, if you miss them, the board won't operate as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two top jumpers at **CN2** connect the main MCU debug port with the USB connector. You don't need those jumpers for normal operation of the board, but, if you remove them, you won't be able to upload any new firmware on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **JP5** jumper is a two position jumper that selects how the main MCU is powered. In order to power the MCU using the USB connector, it shall be on the right *U5V* position. If you put it on the left *E5V* position, you will need to power the MCU using the **E5V** pin at the **CN7** connector. If you take out the jimpler, the MCU won't be powered at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final **JP6** jumper connects the $3.3V$ rail with the main MCU $V_{DD}$ input. This jumper is meant to be substituted by an amperimeter to measure the current consumed by the MCU. You should never take off this jumper as it will remove the MCU power input."

    "The **F303RE** board has available male output pins both in the top and bottom sides. A problem with bottom side pins is that they can short if they touch any metallic object on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you should do before using the board is to add three spacers below the board and bolt them to three M3 screws as shown in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Board Screws](images/Board_01/screws.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's better to use plastic spacers because they don't conduct current. If you use metallic spacers be sure that they don't touch any electrically active node of the board.\n",

    "* **E5V** is a pin available on **CN8** that enables powering the MCU from an external regulated $5V$ supply\n",
    "* **+5V** is the the power rail, **E5V** or **U5V**, selected by **JP5** to power the main MCU\n",
    "* **+3V3** is the $3.3V$ rail before the **JP6** current measurement jumper\n",
    "* **VDD** is the $3.3V$ rail after the **JP6** current measurement jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that transistor **T2** connects the **U5V** rail to the **JP5** jumper. This transistor will only turn when the **PWR_ENn** signal is enabled after the power negotiation with the PC succeeds. If your PC is not able to provide the required power, you can use an external power supply. In this case you would put the **JP5** jumper on the left *E5V* position and will use either the **E5V** or the **VIN** pins to power the main MCU. This option has the added benefit that, as the MCU is not powered by the host PC, the PC is somewhat more proteccted against user errors.  \n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see in the schematic the MCU **VDD** $3.3V$ rail is provided by the **U4** regulator. That isolates somewhat the MCU supply from the USB power rail. That offers some protection if, for instance, you short the the $V_{DD}$ rails on the breadboard when doing some experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also that the red **LD3** LED is connected to the $5V$ rail so, as explained before, having it lit does not mean that the $3V3$ rail is available."
