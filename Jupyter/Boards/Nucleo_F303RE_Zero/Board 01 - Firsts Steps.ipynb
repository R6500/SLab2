    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hardware board** is the basic instrument in the SLab Python project. It shall include, at least, two **DACs** and four **ADCs**. A **Digital to Analog Converter** (DAC) is a device that, given an input digital number, can generate a voltage output proportional to this number. An **Analog to Digital Converter** (ADC) is a device that, given a voltage in its input, measures it and returns a digital number that is proportional to the measured voltage. So, if we have a circuit to test, we can force two voltages using the two DACs and we can measure up to four node voltages using the four ADCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board communicates with a PC using a **serial COM link**. Classic serial RS-232 links are not implemented in most modern PCs, so the serial connection is usually implemented inside an **USB** link. The board is usually powered by the PC so no external power supplies are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any programmable microcontroller board that features a COM link, and, at least, two DACs and four ADCs, can be used as the hardware board if it is programmed with the proper firmware. An Arduino UNO board won't do, for instance, because although it features several ADCs, it doesn't include any DAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board firmware basically waits for a command request from the PC. When a command is received it interacts with the ADCs and DACs depending on the request. On some requests, information is brought back to the PC when the command ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we will use the [STM32 Nucleo64 F303RE](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html) demonstration board, shown in the figure below, as the hardware board. As the full name is too long, we will call it the **F303RE Board** in the rest of this document. \n",
    "\n",
    "![NucleoF303RE Board](images\\Board_01\\F303RE.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **official** SLab hardware board in the sense that a firmware is provided for it. **SLab** does not have any relationship with **ST**. We just use their board and provide a firmware. Consult the [SLab Board Folder](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Boards) for up to date information of any other officially supported boards.  \n",
    "As the communicatuion protocol is documented, you are free to use any non official board but, in this case, writing the firmware is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [F303RE Board](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html) is a microcontroller board that [ST](http://www.st.com/) provides as a way to demonstrate one of their ARM Cortex 32 bit microcontrollers, the [STM32F303RE](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32f3-series/stm32f303/stm32f303re.html). This microcontroller is quite interesting because is part of the [STM32F3](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f3-series.html?querycriteria=productId=SS1576) fammily. Microcontrollers on this familly feature a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 core (with FPU and DSP instructions) running at 72 MHz. The core is surrounded with a lot of peripherals some of them specifically designed for analog processing. The interesting peripherals respect to the **SLab** systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Up to four independent 12bit ADCs with 5 MSPS (Million Samples Per Second) capability\n",
    "* Up to three 12bit DACs (some with analog drivers)\n",
    "* Up to four embedded Operational Amplifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "The ST manufacturer produces the Nucleo Board and sells them practically at cost price to promote their microcontrollers. ST produces, also, the Discovery series of boards that usually include a microcontroller and some peripherals. There are other families of boards produced by ST, but the Nucleo and Discovery series are the cheapest ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three series of Nucleo boards, the Nucleo 32 , Nucleo 64 and Nucleo 144 that feature 32 pin, 64 in or 144 pin microcontrollers. The **F303RE board** is one the the intermediate 64 pin ones. All the Nucleo boards are [MBED](https://www.mbed.com/en/) enabled. That means that they all are programmable using a web based MBED compiler at its [developer site](https://developer.mbed.org/). So you don't need to install any toolchain to program a Nucleo board. In fact, the first versions of the SLab firmware were compiled using MBED. The current version of the **F303RE Board** firmware has been developed on [ChibiOS/RT](http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php), however.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any point you are tired of the SLab work, you can start learning about MCU programming using the F303RE board in the easy to set MBED environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An MBED enabled board also features an easy way to program the board with a binary firmware file. The board, upon connection through USB, is seen as a mass storage disk. Just **drag and drop** the firmware file over the shown disk and you are done."

    "\n",
    "In order to use the board, in our case, the F303RE Board, we need to connect it to a PC. In most cases it will be automatically detected and drivers will be loaded for if needed you can manually install the drivers before connecting the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo boards use a ST-LINK/V2-1 interface to communicate with the PC. The Windows drivers can be located inside the [F303RE Board page](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html).

    "\n",
    "The USB protocol enables a connected system to be seen as several different devices at the same time. If all goes well, after connecting the board to the PC, it will be seen with three different interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A mass storage device (like an external hard disk)\n",
    "* A serial communication COM port\n",
    "* A debug port\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the storage device just once to transfer the firmware to the board. Most of the time we will use the COM port as this is the link for the requests sent from the Python code to the hardware board. We won't never use the debug communication link. Neither is needed for normal web based MBED programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the SLab work has been developed in a **Windows machine**, so no intensive checks have been performed on **Linux** and no test at all has been developed on **MAC** computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been tested that the drivers install automatically, at least for the mass storage and COM port on **Ubuntu Linux**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Nucleo board includes two microcontrollers, one, a **STM32F103** next to the USB connector, implements the ST-LINK/V2-1 that communicates with the PC. And the second one, the bigger **STM32F303RE** 64 pin chip at the center of the board, is where we store our firmware. So, in fact, we have two firmwares in the board, one for each microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "ST releases from time to time new firmwares for the STM32F103 microcontroller that takes care of the ST-LINK connection. You can find an installer program for this firmware on the [F303RE board page](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f303re.html). It is recommended to run this installer to guarantee that the STLINK firmware is up to date, but it never hurts to try without doing that. Anyway, upgrading the firmware is the first step to take if you experience any communication problem with the board. As far as I know this installer only works on Windows, so you would need a Windows system to upgrade the STLINK firmware."
