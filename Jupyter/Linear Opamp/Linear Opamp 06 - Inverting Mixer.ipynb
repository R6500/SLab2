    "\n",
    "In order to analyze this circuit we can see that, as $V_{(-)}$ voltage is zero, the current on resistors $R_2$ and $R_3$ is independent on each other. Also, in order to comply with the [Kirchhoff Current Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws), current at $R_1$ shall be the sum of currents at $R_2$ and $R_3$.\n",
