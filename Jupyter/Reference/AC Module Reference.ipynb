    "\n",
    "Note that the **SLab** system is not designed for frequency response characterization. As the hardware boards don't feature any amplification circuit, dynamic range is poor. Using 12 bit ADCs and DACs we can get a maximum dynamic range of 72dB but that's only true at ideal conditions. Taking into account that the signals won't usually reach the full range of the converters and the measurement noise, the dynamic range will be much lower. For instance, with a 10mV noise and signals that only reach half Vdd range, the dynamic range will be reduced to 44dB. That's only two decades for a first order zero or pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, using an experimental setup that makes uses of most of the ADC range you can obtain about 60 dB dynamic range in magnitude measurements as dB measurements are logarithmic and thus are quite forgiving for noise errors. Phase measurements, however, will be contaminated with noise much before reaching this point.\n",
