    "Typical microcontroller boards usually have poor ADC and DAC converters performance under non ideal conditions. This is due, as we will explain, to loading effects. To improve the board performace, the first **SLab** implementation, that we will call **classic**, used external componets to buffer the converters. The **SLab** implementation described in this document is called **Zero** because it doesn't require any external buffer component. \n",

    "## Need for a buffer setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Microcontroller (MCU) devices usually include a CPU, flash memory, RAM memory and several peripherals in a single integrated circuit. Most MCU input/outputs work with very low current levels because current drivers take-up too much silicon space. That means that ADCs and DACs are quite sensitive to loading effects. If you are not convinced about that, the rest of this section gives a more detailed explanation. If you don’t want to mess with the details, you can skip to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading effects appear when a load takes current from a source. Take as an example the following circuit where a DAC that we use to generate a voltage $V_{DAC}$, with an output resistance $R_{DAC}$, is connected to a resistive load $R_{Load}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig01](images/Board_02/fig01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage at the load will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{Load} = V_{DAC} \\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{Load}+R_{DAC}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The voltage at the load won’t be the same as the value we programmed on the DAC. Let’s calculate the how high the load resistance needs to be so that the error is less than 1%:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_{Load}}{V_{DAC}} \\geq 0.99 \\qquad R_{Load} \\geq 99 \\cdot R_{DAC}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **F303RE** board features a DAC with a maximum specified output resistance of $15k\\Omega$ as it can be seen on the MCU datasheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig01](images/Board_02/DAC_Specs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that, in order to have a less than 1% error, the load must be over $1,5M\\Omega$. Moreover, as in this board the DAC has 12 bit resolution, we need to have an error of less than about 0,01% for it to be negligible. That will increase the load requirements to over $150M\\Omega$. The end result is that, if our budget error is small, we cannot connect the DAC to any load at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem is to add a buffer with unity gain on the output of the DAC that does not load it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig02](images/Board_02/fig02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a similar problem with the ADCs. The MCU ADCs are used to read the voltage on a circuit node. We can model any DC circuit with a Thevenin equivalent. The model of the ADC is more complex that the one of the DAC, however. Typical [SAR ADCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive_approximation_ADC) can be modeled as a RC network and a switch. Whenever you want to read an ADC input, you close the switch so that the $V_{ADC}$ equals the $V_{TH}$ voltage we want to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig03](images/Board_02/fig03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes time to load the $C_{ADC}$ capacitance to a voltage close enough to the open circuit $V_{TH}$ voltage. In the case of the F303RE board, the manufacturer recommends $R_{TH}$ to be always below $47k\\Omega$. At maximum sample rates, however, it shall be below $18\\Omega$ if we want the full 12 bit resolution of the ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $C_{ADC}$ capacitor is depleted on each reading so we need to drain some charge from the circuit every time we read it with the ADC.\n",
    " \n",
    "In general, although at low sample frequencies the problem is not as big as in the DACs, we also need to drive the ADC inputs with a unity gain buffer:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the **SLab Classic** solution we used six external **operational amplifiers** to buffer, with unity gain, the 2 DACs and 4 ADCs of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig05](images/Board_02/fig05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **SLab Zero** solution we use the resources already included inside the MCU to provide the needed buffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F303 board MCU includes one buffer for each DAC. If you recall the DAC table previously shown in this document table, the $15k\\Omega$ output resistance is for the case that doesn't use the internal buffer. When using the internal buffer, the table indicates that you can drive resistances as low as   $5k\\Omega$ if connected to ground or as low as $25k\\Omega$ if connected to Vdd.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the **Notebooks** inside the **Demo** folder, called **\"DAC Analysis\"** gives a better insight on the DAC buffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we can use smaller resistor loads if we relax the measurement accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all the solution for the **SLab Zero** implementation is to rely on the internal DAC buffers. That will suit low load circuits. For the cases where more current is needed we will use two alternative options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use an ADC connected to the DAC output. That way, although the DAC output can be different from the programmed value, we will measure the **real** applied voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use of an external **operational amplifier**, like the **MCP6002** to provide a second buffering layer. This buffer will be part of the test circuit when it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one additional gotcha associated to the **F303 Board**. The second DAC is hardware connected to the **user LED** of the board. That induces some loading effect on the DAC. That means that the load capabilities of **DAC2** are poorer than the ones on **DAC1**."

    "The F303 board MCU includes, as part of its internal peripheral set, four opamps. That means that we can use them instead of using external devices. Unfortunatelly one of the internal opamps output nodes conflicts with the pin used for the USB serial communication. That means that one opamp is out if we don't want to modify the board hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "In AC operation we want to operate the ADCs as fast as possible. The F303 board MCU features four independent hardware ADCs, that means that we can measure four voltages at the same time without needing to multiplex the signals.
