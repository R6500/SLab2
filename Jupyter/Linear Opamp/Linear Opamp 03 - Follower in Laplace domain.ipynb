    "\n",
    "The zero order operational amplifier asumes that the output $V_O$ of the amplifier is $A$ times the differential voltage $V_d$. That gives us the model shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig01](images\\L_OA_03\\fig01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in a previous document, the stability of linear opamp circuits depends on the time response of the device. The estability is related to the **dynamics** of the circuit. And, the mathematic way to deal with dynamics is using **differential equations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order model of the amplifier is just like the previous zero order model but, now, the output voltage $V_O$ doesn't respond inmediatelly to the input $V_d$ change. There is some delay that can be modelled using a differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dV_O(t)}{dt}=\\frac{A_O \\cdot V_d(t)-V_O(t)}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Oberve that we use $A_O$ instead of $A$ in the first order model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the above equation to obtain the $V_O(t)$ response of the circuit for a given $V_d(t)$ signal. In the case of a step change in $V_d$ the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_O = A_O \\cdot V_d + (V_O(0) - A_O \\cdot V_d) \\cdot e^{-t / \\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not the only way the solve the problem. We can use the **\"S\"** domain instead of the **time** domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **\"S\"** domain relates to the [Laplace Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform). This transform converts a function defined in the **time** domain to a function defined in the **“s”** domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(t) e^{-s \\cdot t} dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a differential equation the derivatives are converted to multiplications by **S**. So the operational amplifier differential equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s \\cdot V_O(s)=\\frac{A_O \\cdot V_d(s)-V_O(s)}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have changed from the **time domain** to the **S domain** all variables that previously depend ed on **time**, now depend on **S**. Solving for $V_O$ we obtain:\n",

    "$$V_O(s)=\\frac{A_O}{1+\\tau \\cdot s}V_d(s)$$\n",

    "The equation asociated to the quotient between the output and the input of a system is called the [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function) $H(s)$, so it can be written as:\n",

    "The zeros of the $poly_N(s)$ numerator are the S values that make the numerator zero. At these points the tranfer function is zero, so they are called **zeros** of the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zeros of the $poly_D(s)$ denominator are the S values that make the denominator zero. At these points the transfer function is infinity. They are commonly called **poles** of the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any polinomial has a number of zeros that equal the polinomial order. However, the zeros of a polinomial are not always **real** numbers. Sometimes they are [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number). When they are complex they always come in pairs that have the same **real** value and opposite **imaginary** value. That's the only way to have complex poles in a polinomial with real coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our operational amplifier $H(s)$ function there is a **pole** $p_1$ and no **zeros** on the transfer function. The pole is the S value that makes zero the denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 + p_1 \\cdot \\tau = 0 \\qquad p_1 = \\frac{1}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the MCP6002 amplifier the $\\tau$ value is $63 ms$, the pole $p_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_1=\\frac{1}{63 ms}=15.87 rad/s$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$V_O(s)=\\frac{A_O}{1+\\frac{s}{p1}}V_d(s)$$\n",

    "Now we want to return to the time domain to know $V_O(t)$. This is usually done by identification of the **S** domain functions, we see two particular functions. One, $1/s$ is the **step** function, the other is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{-\\alpha \\cdot t} u(t) \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{s+\\alpha}$$\n",

    "Our function has not exactly a $s + \\alpha$ denominator, so we can rewrite it as:\n",

    "$$V_O(s)=\\frac{A_O \\cdot V_d \\cdot p1}{s+p1}\\frac{1}{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The product of two functions in the **S** domain is the [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) of their equivalents in the time domain. And we don't want to mess with that. So, we need to convert the product of functions to a sum of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_O(s)=\\frac{A_O \\cdot V_d \\cdot p1}{s+p1}\\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{B}{s+p1} + \\frac{C}{s}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Opamps are the basic building blocks of linear analog circuits, but they depend on negative feedback to operate. Designing systems that operate on negative feedback is tricky. Opamps manufacturers want to ease the work of the circuit designers so that they buy more opamps from them. The end result is that most opamps are designed specifically so that they are easy to use on negative feedback systems. You normally don't need to think about feedback. It just works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a negative feedback circuit based on a normal opamp with a dominant pole will have good stability if we only use a negative attenuation feedback network that doesn’t add significant delays to the feedback signal. The follower we had tested doesn’t add any delay but it also doesn’t give any attenuation. That’s why for most opamps, the follower is the circuit that is nearer the edge of instability.\n",
