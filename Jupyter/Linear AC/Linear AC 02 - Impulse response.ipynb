    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we have described the **capacitor** and used its equation to solve the output of a circuit against two different inputs. Now, we want to ease obtaining the solution of any circuit tgat contains capacitors for any possible input signal. In order to do that, we will apply some mathematical linear tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have described the capacitor in the previous chapter. The question that arises is. Is the capacitor linear?. And the answer is a **qualified** yes. If you remember, the capacitor current $i_C$ depends on the capacitor voltage as shown in the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i_C = C \\frac{d v_C}{d t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is linear. Multiplying by a constant $C$ is a linear operation and diferentiating is also a linear operation. Let's see now the equation that obtains the $v_C$ voltage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_C = V_C(0) + \\frac{1}{C} \\int^t_0 i_C \\cdot dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation **is not linear**. Multiplying by $1/C$ is linear, integrating is linear, but addind the $V_C(0)$ constant **is not linear**. This is problem, because we need linear components to have linear circuits. And we need linear circuit to apply to them all the mathematical tricks that only work with linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two solutions to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **first solution** is wisely choosing the zero time. The numbers on the time line are completely arbitrary. We can put the zero time whenever we choose. Just set the zero time when you know that the the capacitor voltage $v_C$ is zero. Easy peasy. Problem solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first solution don't always work. Sometimes the voltage is **never** zero. Sometimes we have several capacitors and they are never zero at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **second solution** always work and consists in detaching the capacitor from its initial conditions. Any capacitor with non zero initial conditions $V_C(0)$ is equivalent to a zero initial conditions capacitor in series with an independent source that carries the capacitor's initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Equivalent](images\\Linear_AC_02\\initial_conditions.png)\n",

    "## LTI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits that you can build using independent sources and linear components, whether they have **state** or not, can be included in the **Linear Time-Independent (LTI)** system cathegory.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **LTI** system is **linear** so its outputs (voltages and currents) are linear functions of its inputs (independent sources) but also is **Time-Independent**. That means that its behavior is insensitive to a time translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we have a **LTI** system $f$ and feed it with an imput $x(t)$ that changes with time we will get an output $y(t)$ that changes with time:\n",

    "$$x(t) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} y(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = f(x(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if we shift the input in time by a $t_0$ amount, the output will shift by the same amount:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t-t_0) \\overset{f}{\\longrightarrow} y(t-t_0) \\qquad y(t-t_0)=f(x(t-t_0))$$\n",

    "Having an **LTI** system permits describing the system using its **Impulse Response**. To ease the explanations we will consider in this document systems that only have one input and one output.
