    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main uses of the diodes is **signal rectification**. This very useful in two important electronic domains: power supplies and signal demodulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Respect to power supplies, most electronic devices power on DC voltages, but we get on the wall socket an AC voltage. So, most electronic devices that are connected to mains need to rectify and filter the AC voltage to obtain a DC voltage to power its electronics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Respect to demodulation, in the case of over the air signal transmission, like AM broadcasts, the audio signal is transmitted by modulating an AM radio frequency carrier. There are other systems that use amplitude modulation like FSK data transmissions and most Infrared remote control units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to remove the carrier from the amplitude modulated signal, rectification can also be used. \n",
    "In this document we will analyze the basic rectifier and we will use it do rectify and filter a sine wave. We will also use it to demodulate and amplitude modulated signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before we start working with the rectifier, we will need to deal to a voltage range problem associated to the SLab system. This will also serve us to introduce the bridge excitation of circuits."

    "## Using bridges for more voltage range\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLab system uses a microcontroller (MCU) development board to generate and measure the circuit under test (CUT) signals. Most modern MCUs operate at low voltages. In the case of the **F303RE Nucleo** board, for instance, we use a 3.3V voltage supply. That means that both the signals we generate and we measure need to be inside the range from GND to Vdd.\n",
    "If we want to generate a sine wave inside this voltage range we are limited to a signal like the one on the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vdd Range](images/D_04/vdd_range.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the signal don't go from $0V$ to $3.3 V$ but from $0.1 V$ to $3.2 V$. We are further limited by the fact that the buffers we use, although being full rail, need some voltage margin (several $mV$) from the supplies to operate, so we leave a $100 mV$ margin to the supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, our maximum peak to peak amplitude is $3.1 V$ and our amplitude is $1.55 V$. Taking into account that a basic rectifier has a $0.7 V$ drop, that gives a quite low output voltage. The problem is worse if we use a more advanced bridge rectifier that has, as we will see later, a two diode $1.4 V$ drop. In that case we obtain practically no signal at the rectifier output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to cope with this problem we need to increase the voltage range we provide to our circuits. A doubled range of $6.2 V$ instead of $3.1 V$ would be enough. One way to obtain that would be to use an external supply and a specific new driver circuit to interface with the hardware board, but that will complicate too much the measurement setup. A second way is the use of bridge configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal grounded configurations define all supplies respect to a common ground node. So, a two terminal device under test (DUT) will have one grounded terminal and the other terminal connected to a voltage supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grounded Load](images/D_04/grounded_circuit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **DAC1** voltage is generated by a system powered between $0 V$ and $3.3V$, the maximum voltage at the DUT will be $3.3 V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bridged configuration, instead of grounding one terminal of the DUT, connects both terminals to two different supplies:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bridged Load](images/D_04/bridged_load.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If both **DACs** can generate voltages between $0 V$ and $3.3 V$, the maximum voltage on the DUT $V_{DUT}$ will be $3.3 V$ (with **DAC1** at $3.3 V$ and **DAC2** at $0 V$) and the minimum voltage on the DUT will be $-3.3 V$ (with **DAC1** at $0 V$ and **DAC2** at $3.3 V$) giving a total voltage range of $6.6 V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we will restrict ourselves to a range in the **DACs** between $0.1 V$ and $3.2 V$. In the following figure we show a $V_1$ sine wave between $0.1 V$ and $3.2 V$ and a $V_2$ sine wave with the same range but opposite phase. The voltage difference between both signals will have a range between $+3.1 V$ and $3.1 V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bridged Signals](images/D_04/bridged_signals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This neat trick is typically used on audio amplifiers to double the voltage range on the output speakers. In the case of car audio we can get a $+12 V$ to $-12 V$ range ($24 V$ total range) out of the $12 V$ car battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Car Audio](images/D_04/car_audio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the circuits described in this document we will use the bridge configuration to obtain the response of several rectifier circuits against inputs that can have a range of up to $+3.1 V$ to  $3.1 V$. To round the numbers we will start using a $+3 V$ to  $3 V$ range.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the measurements, using the bridge configuration, we must guarantee that the voltages read on the **ADCs** are always inside the supply range of the hardware board. This requirement is easy in resistive circuits, but in reactive circuits, like when using inductors or capacitors, it could be tricky."

    "In this project we have dealt with two rectifier topologies: the basic half wave rectifier and the full wave bridge rectifier. We have seen applications both for obtaining a DC voltage from an AC sine voltage and for demodulating an AM signal. Although those two applications are very important, the diodes can be used for many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important subject in this document is the electronics **bridge** concept. It is important to understand it because it can be used in a lot of applications. Bridges are used to inject a signal to a circuit, as in the bridged DAC configuration we have used in the measurements or in the diode bridge, but they can also be used to perform measurements like in the [Wheatstone bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge).  \n",
    "In the SLab system we will use the bridge both to provide positive and negative excitations to a circuit from an unipolar supply and to broaden the voltage range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this document we have dealt also with the need for a DC path to ground when we perform floating differential measurements. Most measurement instruments require a DC path from the measured node to the instrument ground reference and this fact is easy to be overlooked if you perform a differential measurement by subtracting two ground referenced measurements.
