    "\n",
    "The **SLab** system use a **slab.py** module to communicate with the hardware board. So you need Python to use the board in this environment. From **SLab** version **1.4** onwards, **Python 3.x** is the main test environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system relies on several modules, basically [PySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/) to communicate with the board [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) to make calculations, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to show graphs and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) for the interactive documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and add those packages or you can go the easy way and install a bundle that incorporates most needed packages like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that is available for Windows, Linux and Mac.\n",
