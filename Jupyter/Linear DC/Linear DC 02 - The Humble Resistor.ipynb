    "## Ohm's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, a resistor is a component that complies with [Ohm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law). This law is applicable to two terminal components whose voltage is proportional to the applied current.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = I \\cdot R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most conductors like copper, aluminium, carbon and so on satisfy this law. This is interesting because it is not evident from a **charge carrier** point of view. Let's build a resistor using a cilindrical piece of conducting material.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Conductor 1](images\\Linear_DC_02\\conductor1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our conductor is cylindrical, has a length $L$ and a surface are on $S$ on both sides. The applied voltage is $V$ and the current that travels inside it is $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply a voltage, an electric field is produced inside the conductor. If the conductor is uniform, the field is constant and can be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{V}{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conductors, like copper, contain **charge carriers**, those are charged particles that can freely move, like electrons. Charge carriers, are compensated, when needed, by fixed charged particles so that the conductor is kept neutral. The following example shows a representation of a conductor, like copper, where each atom can leave free one electron leaving a fixed position positive copper ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Conductor 2](images\\Linear_DC_02\\conductor2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric field creates a **force** $F$ on each carrier that is proportional to its charge $q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = q E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The force produces an acceleration that depends on the charge mass $m$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = \\frac{F}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not seem than an accelerated carrier movement would comply with Ohm's Law. Although what happens inside a conductor is related to conduction in solids and is into the realm of **Quantum Mechanics**, we can use the simplified [Drude Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model) to give a rough explanation of the carrier movement.\n",
    "What roughly happens is that the **carriers** interact with fixed particles or defects in the lattice, inside the conductor. So, the carriers cannot go to long before they impact with fixed elements inside the conductor. When that happens, the carriers are stoped or deflected in any random direction, they loose they energy, and they need to accelerate again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net effect is an average **drift speed** $u$ of the carriers inside the conductor that is proportional to the carrier acceleration on each free path. The $\\tau$ value in the formula is an equivalent time a charge travels before it interacts with fixed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = \\frac { qE \\tau }{m}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the **drift speed** of the carriers is proportional to the **Electric Field** an thus, to the applied voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = \\frac { qV \\tau }{m L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To relate the current on the conductor with the drift speed, we can think of the volume where there will be carriers that leave the component each $\\Delta t$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Conductor 3](images\\Linear_DC_02\\conductor3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The carriers that will leave the component will be inside a volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Vol = S \\cdot u \\cdot \\Delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the number of carriers that leave the conductor will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = \\delta \\cdot S \\cdot v \\cdot \\Delta t\n",
    "=   \\delta \\cdot S  \\cdot \\Delta t \\frac { qV \\tau }{m  L}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\delta$ is the density of carriers inside the component.  \n",
    "If each carrier has a $q$ charge, the total charge that leaves the component is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = q \\cdot n = q \\cdot \\delta \\cdot S  \\cdot \\Delta t \\frac { qV \\tau }{m  L}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the current leaving the component will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = \\frac{Q}{\\Delta t} \n",
    "= \\frac{q^2 \\delta \\tau}{m} \\frac{S}{L} V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that there are some geometrical constants S and L, and some constants that depend on the material the component is made of $q$, $\\delta$, $\\tau$, $m$. We can group together those last constants in a **conductivity constant** ($\\sigma$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\frac{q^2 \\delta \\tau}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the current can be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = \\sigma \\frac{S}{L} V $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we get that the current is proportional to the voltage. The proportionality constant is called **conductivity** ($G$) and is measured in **Siemens** ($S$) units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = G \\cdot V \\qquad G = \\sigma \\frac{S}{L} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we isolate $V$ in the above equation we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\frac{I}{G} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $1/G$ value is used a lot, so it has its own **resistance** name and its own unit **Ohm**  ($\\Omega$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{1}{G} \\qquad \\Omega = \\frac{1}{S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Resistance can be calculated from the **conductivity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{L}{S} $$\n",
