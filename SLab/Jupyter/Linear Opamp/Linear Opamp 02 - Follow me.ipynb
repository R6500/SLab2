In this circuit, an external input $V_i$, generated by DAC 1, is connected to the positive input (+) and the output of the opamp $V_O$, read by ADC 1, is feedback to the negative input (-). We also add an ADC 2 connection to the input node $V_i$ so that we can measure the exact voltage applied on the circuit.\n",

    "If we let go the train, it will go down to the valley, but when it reaches it, it has gained enough speed to climb up the other side. It won’t reach P2 because it has lost part of the energy due to friction. In the end the train will do several movements from one side of the valley to the other until it finally stops. We say that the system is **underdamped** because it oscillates around the equilibrium point before stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be grateful of friction because it makes the train finally stop. If there was more friction, or a lower slope, the system could reach the bottom of the valley without any oscillation. In this case we say that the system is **overdamped**. The limit between this two cases is a **critically damped** system where we reach the equilibrium point as fast as possible without oscillations.\n",
    "If there was no friction at all with the rails or the air, the train will eternally move between points P1 and P2 making the system a **mechanical oscillator**.\n",

    "If we try too hard to compensate the perturbations with too much negative feedback, as is the roller coaster case without friction, the system will oscillate without being able to rest on any equilibrium point.\n",

    "Using negative feedback, as in the first follower, makes the circuit stable, but unity gain, as obtained in the follower, is just on the limit of stability for most opamps. This is due to the fact that the follower uses a lot of negative feedback. As $V_{(-)} = V_O$, the negative feedback is as big as the output perturbation. In general, any negative feedback circuit that feeds back only a fraction of the perturbation will also be stable. However, you can’t guarantee the stability if you give a negative feedback to the input that is greater that the output perturbation.\n",

    "The **first order** opamp model assumes that there is some delay between the change in the input $V_d$ voltage and the change in the output $V_O$ voltage. The delay, however, is not constant, it depends on how far is the output voltage of the value where it should be.\n",

In fact, not using the Laplace transform enables us to understand the circuit operation in the less abstract time domain.\n",

    "We have seen that, due to the time response of the amplifier, the result is only valid when there is an **stable** equilibrium point thanks to the **negative feedback**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in the time domain we have demonstrated, both using simulations and analytical calculations, that the **negative feedback** gives a proper follower circuit whereas using **positive feedback** gives us a bad follower circuit that saturates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating in the time domain is good because it gives good intuitive explanations of the circuit operation. The problem is that the time domain requires us to work on differential equations that are not always easy to solve. That's why we commonly use the **Laplace transform** as we will see in the following document."
