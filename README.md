# SLab2

New version of the **SLab** system

The SLab system is a low cost electronics Lab aimed to teaching electronics

It uses a cheap demostration board to interface with a circuit under test

User interface is built around **Jupyter Notebooks** that contain **Python** Code

In order to use the software you need to have a working Python 3 system with Jupyter installed

Copy the main *"SLab"* folder to anywhere in your system

Jupyter shall start on the *"SLab/Jupyter"* folder

Before starting Jupyter, the **PHYTHONPATH** variable should point to the *"Code"* folder

The *"SLab/Jupyter.bat"* and the *"SLab/Custom.bat"* files are launch script examples for Windows that works for an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python3 installation.

The *"Slab/Jupyter.sh" is a launch script example for Linux that also works for an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python3 installation.

All the files are provided in a zip file *"SLab (version).zip"* file to ease downloading.
