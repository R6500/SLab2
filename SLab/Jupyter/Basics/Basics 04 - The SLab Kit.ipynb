    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Small Lab** (SLab) project pretends to ease self learning in electronics. The objective of the project is to learn by working on lab measurements. That is, by building and measuring circuits.  \n",
    "Practical work is quite normal in most engineering subjects. This work is usually performed in the laboratories of the schoool.  \n",
    "The objective of the **SLab** system is to move the practical work out of the laboratories by providing a cheap small but powerful measurement system that can be used anywhere.  \n",
    "The **SLab** system requires a **Hardware Board**, some jumper wires, a solderless breadboard and components to build circuits. There are multiple options to build a working SLab system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example the **Fat Board** adds some standard banana, BNC and Jack connectors to the basic SLab system. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Fat Board](images/Basics_04/fat_board.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more compact size, the **Long Board** fit all the basic SLab elements to a base plate so that they are mechanically joined together.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Long Board](images/Basics_04/long_board.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most minimalistic version of the system is the **Minimal SLab System**. It just includes a hardware board, a bread board and the jumper wires without any mechanical support. By being minimalistic, the system can be obtained without the added time and cost associated to mechanical actions. The system, when working, should resemble someting like the following image.\n",

    "## What should be in the Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "The kit of needed elements to work on the **SLab tutorials** is divided in two main sets of components: **The SLab System** and an **Electronics Components Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SLab System** should be, at least, composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **Hardware Board** \n",
    "* An **USB Mini** cable to connect the board to the computer\n",
    "* 10 Female to Male Jumper Wires to connect the **Hardware Board** with the **Breadboard**\n",
    "* A Solderless **Breadboard** to build the circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add to the above a **carrying case**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good option for the **Hardware Board** is the [STM32F303RE Nucleo64](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303re.html) demonstration board. In fact, at the time of writting this document, it was the better supported board by far.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained, the **Nucleo Board** and the **Breadboard** can be provided combined on a **Long Board** setup or they can be separated from each other as in the **Minimal SLab System**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows a **SLab Kit** case that includes most of the components described in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](images/Basics_04/SLab_Kit_Inside.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Electronics Components Set** is a set of electronic components that is enough for all the proposed **SLab** experiments. It curretly includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A box to put inside all the components  \n",
    "* Two **resistor sets** from $10\\Omega$ to $820k\\Omega$    \n",
    "* 12 capacitors: $1nF$, $10nF$, $100nF$, $1\\mu F$, $10 \\mu F$ and $100 \\mu F$ (2 of each value)\n",
    "* 2x $10 k\\Omega$ trimpots\n",
    "* 2x MCP6002 Dual Opamp DIP8 Integrated Circuits\n",
    "* 2x BC547B NPN BJT transistors\n",
    "* 2x BC557B PNP BJT transistors\n",
    "* A BS170 NMOS transistor\n",
    "* A TP2104 PMOS transistor\n",
    "* 4x 1N4148 silicon diodes\n",
    "* 4x BAT42 Schottky diodes\n",
    "* 4x LED diodes: 2 red, 1 Green, 1 Blue\n",
    "* Some pieces of unifilar electric wire with different colors \n",
    "\n",
    "The **datasheets** of most of those components can be found on the [SLab Kit Datasheets Folder](/tree/SLab%20Kit/Datasheets)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows a **Electronics components box** before adding resistors to the first fow.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](images/Basics_04/Component_Box.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image contains an optional **Supply supervisor** component in the center bottom row. We will talk about it later although it is not usually needed."

    "## Other needed elements\n",
    "\n",
    "A part from the **SLab Kit** you will nedd other elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A PC Computer**  \n",
    "In order to operate the **SLab System** you need a PC computer. The **SLab Kit** is plug and play in a **64 bit Windows** operating system, but it can also operate, if you install the needed **Python** software, on **Linux** or **Mac** computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools for stripping and cutting wires**  \n",
    "Some unifilar wire is provided but you will need to cut it and strip the plastic isolation at its ends. Any cutting plier will do. You could also use scissors but, unless they are designed for cutting copper, you will probably damage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Multimeter**   \n",
    "During the calibration of the **Hardware board** you will need a [Multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter). This instrument is not needed for normal **SLab** operation, so you only need to have access to this instrument once if the board has not been calibrated yet."

    "## Kit One-Time actions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some actions that need to be done on the kit only one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your board has any exposed metallic terminal on the bottom side, you should isolate them from the table using spacers.  \n",
    "In the case of the **F303RE** board, three **M3** screws and spacers are needed.The screw locations are shown on the next figure. Note that screw **number 3** is different because there is too little clearance to the Arduino **CN5** connector on this holes and a normal screw won't fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Board Screws](images/Basics_04/screws.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next action is to implement a LED circuit in the **breadboard**. We will also connect together the two red $V_{DD}$ power strips of the board and the two blue ground $GND$ strips.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LED_Circuit](images/Basics_04/LED_Circuit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The led will light if there is voltage in the breadboard rails. If you are working on a circuit and see the light **turn off**, most probably you are **shorting** the power rails. Disconnect the red wire from the breadboard, check the circuit, and reconnect again to see if the problem has been solved. Note that you cannot use the boad **LD3** LED for that. The **LD3** LED is lit when there is a $5V$ rail available. It does not depend on the $3V3$ rail we are using on the breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locate a $470\\Omega$ resistor in one of the resistor sets and the square red LED.\n",
    "The following figure shows an implementation of this circuit. Note the red wire that connect the two $V_{DD}$ rails and the black wire that connects the two $GND$ rails. In the case of the red LED, the long terminal is the one that needs to be connected to the positive rail. If you connect it wrong, it just wonâ€™t lit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BB_LED](images/Basics_04/BB_LED.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to fitting a LED and a resistor on the breadboard you can use a supply supervisor. The supervisor just includes a **LED** and a $470\\Omega$ **resistor** in a small module that connects over the $3V3$ and $GND$ pins on the **Hardware board**. This way, you don't need to use space on your breadboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Supply Supervisor](images/Basics_04/Supervisor.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to do is to upload the board **firmware**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure could change for each possible hardware board so we will only explain the **F303RE** board case.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we connect the **Hardware Board** to the PC using a mini USB cable. Then wait until the needed drivers are installed. If all goes as it should, this board should be seen from the PC on three different interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An ST-Link Debug interface\n",
    "* A mass storage device\n",
    "* A serial link\n",
    "\n",
    "In SLab we will use only the last two ones. The **mass storage** to upload the firmware and the **serial link** for normal **SLab** operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the driver installations you should see the board as a new external disk on the PC, probably with a name like **\"NODE_F303RE\"**. To install the **SLab** firmware just drag and drop the firmware file on the disk.  \n",
    "The firmware files for the supported boards can be located inside the **SLab/Boards** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the firmware installation you will see the COM **LD1** LED on the board blink. After the firmware installation the LED will turn solid green as shown inside the red square in the next figure. But this will be temporal, on the next power-up this LED will turn red again. So, don't worry about this LED color.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![Green COM](images/Basics_04/green_com2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes ok, you now have a **SLab** enabled **Hardware Board**.    \n",
    "If you have problems uploading the **firmware** check that the two *ST-LINK* jumpers at the top **CN2** connector, shown in the above figure, are in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to do is sorting all electrical components. A plastic box will come handy for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use 5 spaces of the plastic box for the resistors. You will will put the resistors in them according to their value:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $10\\Omega$ to $82\\Omega$ (leftmost space)\n",
    "* $100\\Omega$ to $820\\Omega$\n",
    "* $1k\\Omega$ to $8k2\\Omega$ (center space)\n",
    "* $10k\\Omega$ to $82k\\Omega$\n",
    "* $100k\\Omega$ to $820k\\Omega$ (rightmost space)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resistor values are coded using a [Resistor Color Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code) so, each space will contain resistors ending with a different color (before the gold tolerance ring). \n",
    "\n",
    "You could open the two resistor sets and classify all the resistors according to their values, but this could be quite time consuming. An alternative strategy is to locate the resistor in the sets each time you need a new resistor value and, after using it, put in the proper location of the box. That way, you won't clutter the box with non used resistors. In order to be able to put the resistor in the indicated space you will need to bend both of their terminals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of components go to other box spaces as shown in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6 Non polarized capacitors: $1nF$, $10nF$, $100nF$ (2 of each value)\n",
    "* 6 Electrolitic capacitors: $1\\mu F$, $10 \\mu F$ and $100 \\mu F$ (2 of each value)\n",
    "* 2x $10 k\\Omega$ trimpots and 2x MCP5002 Dual Opamp DIP8 Integrated Circuits\n",
    "* 6 Transistors: 2x BC547B, 2x BC557B, one BS170 and one TP2104\n",
    "* 4x 1N4148 silicon diodes and 4x BAT42 Schottky diodes\n",
    "* 2x MCP6002 Dual Operational Amplifiers  \n",
    "* 3x LED diodes: 1 red, 1 Green, 1 Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do all that you will occupy 12 spaces in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting all components, the plastic box will look like the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](images/Basics_04/Component_Box.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the five resistor spaces on the first row are empty as we have not used any resistor yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leave one or two spaces to put the small one core wire pieces used to connect the components together in the breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "That concludes the **SLab kit** description. "
