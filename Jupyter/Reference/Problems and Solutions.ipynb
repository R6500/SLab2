    "If the board is seen as a mass storage but, when you try to drag and drop the **.bin** file it seems that it has been copied but the **LD1** LED on the board does not blink, most probably you don't have the two needed jumpers fitted on the **CN2** connector.  \n",
    "The **CN2** connector is located at the top of the Nucleo board and provides the debug link to the main board microcontroller (MCU). If any of the two jumpers is missing, you won't be able to upload a new firmware."

    "If the COM LED **LD1** at the top of the board, next to the USB connectior, is ON, that means that the board is powered by the USB cable. Having a **LD3** off means that this power does not reach the main MCU.\n",

    "The Nucleo Board negotiates the power requirements with the PC when it is connected. The main MCU won't be connected to the USB power until this negotiation suceeeds. If your PC cannot supply enough power, or if you are using an USB Hub that cannot provide this power, the main MCU won't receive power and the red **LD3** will be OFF."
