    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main uses of the diodes is **signal rectification**. This very useful in two important electronic domains: power supplies and signal demodulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Respect to power supplies, most electronic devices power on DC voltages, but we get on the wall socket an AC voltage. So, most electronic devices that are connected to mains need to rectify and filter the AC voltage to obtain a DC voltage to power its electronics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Respect to demodulation, in the case of over the air signal transmission, like AM broadcasts, the audio signal is transmitted by modulating an AM radio frequency carrier. There are other systems that use amplitude modulation like FSK data transmissions and most Infrared remote control units.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to remove the carrier from the amplitude modulated signal, rectification can also be used. \n",
    "In this document we will analyze the basic rectifier and we will use it do rectify and filter a sine wave. We will also use it to demodulate and amplitude modulated signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before we start working with the rectifier, we will need to deal to a voltage range problem associated to the SLab system. This will also serve us to introduce the bridge excitation of circuits."

    "As said at the start of the document, obtaining a DC voltage from a sine wave is only one of the main uses of a rectifier circuit. Other of important usages of a rectifier is building amplitude demodulators. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* $50%$ modulation depth   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulation depth parameter means that the modulating signal changes a 50% of the carrier amplitude. In order to generate the signal we first import the **numpy** module and create a 1000 points array. The modulated low frequency signal will have this number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define the angular frequencies relative to this array. As the modulating signal has 1000 points, its period must be 1000 points of X. As the carrier has a frequency 50 times the modulating signal, its period should be 20 points of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can compose the modulated signal multiplying the carrier with a signal that goes from $0.5$ to $1.0$ at the modulating signal frequency. After generating the signal we will show it on screen."

The main drawback of this rectifier is that it only let pass the positive part of the input signal, so we don't get any energy or information from the negative part of the signal. The following circuit, that uses four diodes instead of one, is the **full wave bridge rectifier**. It is called **full wave** because it uses information not only from the positive part of the input wave but also from the negative part. It is called **bridge** because the output has a different reference than the input and is located, between two symmetric subcircuits.\n",

This time, as we have **four** diodes and each one could be in two states (**ON**, **OFF**), the number of combined hypothesis grow to $2^4=16$ possibilities. Testing all of them would be too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, not all hypotheses are possible. In fact only three are possible and we can work out which they are from the circuit. Let's start seeing that all the circuit connected to $V_s$ is passive and resistive. That is, no element is able to store or generate energy. \n",

Current going out of the $V_s$ **(+)** terminal reaches $D1$ and $D3$, but as $D1$ is blocking, it can only go to $D1$, as the current goes through $R_L$, from the positive to the negative terminal, voltage drops before reaching $D2$ and $D4$. Both diodes are in the correct orientation but current cannot go through $D3$ because that would mean going from a lower voltage to a higher voltage and no passive component can do that. That means that current returns to $V_s$ through diode $D4$.\n",
