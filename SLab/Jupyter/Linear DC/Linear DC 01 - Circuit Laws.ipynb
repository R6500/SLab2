    "\n",
    "In electronics we deal with **circuits**, so it is a good idea to define what is a circuit. This is an interesting question because the definition depends on where it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broad sense, a **circuit** can be considered as a set of **components** connected together using **conductors**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **components** we are refering to are **electrical components**. They can have any shape buy they all share the fact that they feature two or more metalic terminals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below we see four examples of components. Nottice that we can have components with different number of terminals: 2 in the case of the resistor, diode and capacitor and three in the case of the transistor. In general, a component can have any number of terminals greater or equal than two.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](images\\Linear_DC_01\\components.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that terminals can go at different sides of the component or all from the same side of the component. For two terminal components those are called [axial and radial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology#Axial_and_radial_leads) lead distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **conductors** can be any piece of material that easily conducts electric charge. Typical metals like aluminium, copper, silver and gold make good conductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect several **components** between them, we join the terminals of the devices with the terminals of other devices using conductors. That can be done in several ways. The following figure shows two examples of circuit implementation. At the left side we see a complex circuit implemented using [Printed Circuit Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) (PCB) technology whereas at the righth we see a much simpler circuit implemented using Solderless [Bread Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard) Technology.\n",

    "The study of electronic circuits is related to the **Circuit Theory** subject. Under this subject, the circuit definition is more restricted. Under circuit theory we define a **circuit** as a set of **components** connected together using **ideal conductors**. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **ideal conductor** is a conductor that allows the movement of charge without requiring any work at all. That means that the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field) inside the conductor is always zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "As circuit theory require **ideal conductors** and there are no ideal conductors in the real world (the closer real deal are superconductors), it follows that no real circuit behaves like circuit theory predicts. Fortunatelly, a lot of circuits behave so close to the ideal behaviour that having non ideal conductors don't matter too much. That's the kind of circuits we will deal with in the SLab tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the end, circuit theory deals with **components** and **ideal conductors**. Electric charge can move inside the ideal conductors and the components but no net charge can be accummulated on any component or any part of a conductor. That means that if one electron enters one conductor or component, another electron needs to go out of the conductor or component at the same time. We can say that the number of electrons in each component or piece of conductor shall be constant. If that does not hold true in a real circuit, then we cannot apply circuit theory to it. The following figure shows an example of the reperesentation of one circuit that features 5 components A, B, C, D and E. Every component features two terminals and the different components are connected together using ideal conductors (in blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit1](images\\Linear_DC_01\\circuit1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that, when we draw a circuit, we don't need to draw the components as they are in the real world. We just use some simbols that represent the components. Don't worry about what kind of components are A, B, C, D or E. We don't need to know that for the explanations that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, all components feature two terminals, but that don't need to be always the same. Remember that we can have components with any number of terminals greater or equal to two.\n",

    "## Charge, Current and Kirchoff's Current Law\n",
    "\n",
    "[Charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) is, like mass, an intrinsec property of matter. There are two kinds of charge: positive and negative. In any electrical circuit or in each part of an ideal conductor, the positive and negative charge has the exact same value so the total net charge is zero at any point of time. Charge can move but we must keep the neutrality. That means that if some charge enters one component trough one terminal the very same change needs to go out at other terminal. In the same way, if some charge enters one **node** the very same charge need to exit the node at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As total net charge in the components and the nodes is always the same, it makes a very bad circuit variable. The interesting property of charge is its movement, no its total quantity. We use the **current intensity** magnitude to describe the charge movement. This property is usually defined at the component terminals and accounts for the total charge that enters or exits one component terminal each time unit (typically each second).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we measure the charge $Q$ in **Coulomb** $[C]$ and the time $t$ in **seconds** $[s]$, then the current intensity $I$ is given in **Ampere** $[A]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I[A] = \\frac{\\Delta Q [C]}{\\Delta t [s]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the conductors need to be kept neutral, that implies that all the current that enters one node needs to be compensated with the current that exits the node at the same time, so, the net current entering a node is always zero. That is the [Kirchoff's Current Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws) (KCL).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad \\sum I_i = 0 \\qquad i = 1...n_{N}\\qquad n_{N}$ : Terminals in node\n",
    "\n",
    "So for each node, the sum of all the currents entering this node from the component terminals shall be zero. In the example below, all currents entering node 1 through components A, B and C shall add to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit4](images\\Linear_DC_01\\circuit4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, as the components also need to be kept neutral, the same rule applies to each component. That is, the sum of currents entering the component through all its terminals is always zero at any time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad \\sum I_i = 0 \\qquad i = 1...n_{C}\\qquad n_{C}$ : Terminals in component\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the two currents entering component C from nodes 1 and 2 shall add to zero. That means that both currents shall be equal but with different sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit5](images\\Linear_DC_01\\circuit5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, as all the components and all the sections of the ideal conductors need to be neutral, the same rule applies also to every possible closed region that crosses the circuit only on the conductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad \\sum I_i = 0 \\qquad i = 1...n_{I}\\qquad n_{I}$ : Conductor intersects with region border\n",
    "\n",
    "In the circuit below we have defined a yellow region. It intersects the circuit at three ideal conductors. That means that the sum of currents entering this region on the three intersects 1, 2 and 3 that go to components C, A and B shall be zero.\n",

    "### Movement charge polarity does not matter\n",
    "\n",
    "In a circuit, it is important to know how the charge moves, but knowing if the moving charges are positive or negative does not matter in most cases. The following example shows three images of charge movement in a conductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Charge Movement](images\\Linear_DC_01\\charges.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a conductor, charges can be fixed (unable to move) or be movable **charge carriers**. In normal solid conductors, like copper, most of the charged particles like protons and electrons are fixed. Only some of the electrons on the outer shells of the atoms can freely move as charge carriers. Let's say, for simplicity that in the above figure all charges, fixed and movable have a value of 1 Coulomb (positive or negative). As therere are at a given time, the same quantity of positive and negative charges, the conductors are neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copper can be represented by the left image. It has some free negative charge carriers that can freely move and the same number of fixed positive charges that keep the conductor neutral. If each second two negative 1 Coulomb charges exit the left side of the conductor, the net **positive** charge flow is 1 Ampere going right. Note that, to keep the conductor neutral, two charges need to also enter from the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The center image shows one alternative example where the fixed charge is negative and the charge carriers are positive. From a circuit theory point of view there is no difference respect to the previous case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right and center cases are called unipolar because there is only one kind of charge carrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe also the right image where we have both positive and negative charge carriers going in opposite directions. As there are two polarities of charge carriers we call this a bipolar conductor. The net current in this case is also 2 Ampere because both charges contribute 1 Ampere to the total current flow that is going right."

    "## Voltage and Kirchoff's Voltage Law\n",
    "\n",
    "As we recall, charge does not require any work or energy to move inside an ideal conductor. This, however, is not always true for  a component. When a charge moves inside a component it can require the consumption of energy. \n",

    "![Gravity](images\\Linear_DC_01\\gravity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy needed to lift object B from platform 2 to platform 3 will be the same energy that will be released if object A rolls down and impacts platform 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravity field is **conservative** because the potential energy an object accumulates depends only on its height and does not depende on how it has reached its current position. Observe also that we don't need to know the distances to the center of the earth, where the energy is zero, to make calculations, we just need to know the height differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charged particles, in an electric field behave like objects with mass in a gravity field. As ideal conductors have zero field it is equivalent to have same height. That means that all carriers that are inside a conductor and have the same charge will have also the same potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field shall be zero on the conductors, but it can be non zero inside the components. That means that a charged particle, when travels inside a component can gain or loose energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define **Voltage Difference** as the electric field equivalent of **Height Difference** in a gravity field. If a **positive** charge gains energy when it goes from one side of the component to the other side of the component we say that the voltage has increased from one terminal to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **voltage** across a component gives us a measurement of the gain or loss of energy (depends on direction) for a charge that travels trough a component. By definition, there is a 1 **Volt** voltage increase when 1 **Coulomb** of charge gains 1 **Joule** of energy and there is a 1 **Volt** voltage drop when 1 **Coulomb** of charge losses 1 **Joule** of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta Voltage[V] = \\frac{\\Delta Energy[J]}{Charge[C]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the electric field is **conservative**, and the components operate on electric fields, the energy of a charged particle inside or a conductor, or node, does not depend on how it has arrived to this conductor but in which conductor, or node, is located. Let's make an example with our previous circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit7](images\\Linear_DC_01\\circuit7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If one charge goes from node 3 to node to node 1 through component B, then goes to node 2 through component C, then to node 4 trough component D and finally returns to node 3 through component E, the total gain of energy shall be zero as we are in the same place where we started. That means that the total sum of voltage increases on components B, C, D and E adds to zero. Note also that the same applies if the charge goes through component A instead of component B. \n",

    "In electronics, the typical convention is to define the energy values as **lost energy**. That means that a **loss** of energy or power will give **positive** values and a **gain** of energy or power will give **negative** values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are measuring the **lost** power, it wil be positive if positive charge moves from higher voltage to lower voltage. When we multiply voltage and current we need to define the current so that it enters the positive terminal or so that it exits the negative terminal.
