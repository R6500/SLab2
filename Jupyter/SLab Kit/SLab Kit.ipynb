    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Small Lab** (SLab) project pretends to ease self learning in electronics. The objective of the project is to learn by working on lab measurements. That is, by building and measuring circuits.  \n",
    "Practical work is quite normal in most engineering subjects. This work is usually performed in the laboratories of the schoool.  \n",
    "The objective of the **SLab** system is to move the practical work out of the laboratories by providing a cheap small but powerful measurement system that can be used anywhere.  \n",
    "The **SLab** system requires a **Hardware Board**, some jumper wires, a solderless breadboard and components to build circuits. There are multiple options to build a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example the **Fat Board** adds some standard banana, BNC and Jack connectors to the basic SLab system.. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Fat Board](images/fat_board.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more compact size, the **Long Board** fit all the basic SLab elements to a base plate so that they are mechanically joined together.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Long Board](images/long_board.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most minimalistic version of the system is the **Minimal SLab System**. It just includes a hardware board, a bread board and the jumper wires without any mechanical support. By being minimalistic, the system can be obtained without the added time and cost associated to mechanical actions. The system, when working, should resemble someting like the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Slab Kit](images/system.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SLab Kit** that relates to this document can include the **Long Board** or just the **Minimal SLab System**. It can be provided in three possible kit options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLab Minikit**  \n",
    "Just contains a Hardware board, an USB cable, 10 jumper wires, and a box of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLab Kit**  \n",
    "Adds a carrying case and a solderless breadboard to the SLab Minikit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Longboard Kit**  \n",
    "Similar to the SLab Kit, but a Longboard is provided instead of just the Minimal SLab System.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of the above kits can contain some additional optional elements."

    "\n",
    "The kit is divided in two main sets of components: **The SLab System** and an **Electronics Components Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SLab System** is, at least, composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An [STM32F303RE Nucleo64](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303re.html) demonstration board that operates as the **SLab Hardware Board**\n",
    "* An **USB Mini** cable to connect the board to the computer\n",
    "* 10 Female to Male Jumper Wires to connect the **Hardware Board** with the **Breadboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SLab Kit** and the **Longboard Kids** add to the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A carying case\n",
    "* A Solderless **Breadboard** to build the circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained, the **Nucleo Board** and the **Breadboard** can be provided combined on a **Long Board** setup or they can be separated from each other as in the **Minimal SLab System**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the kit contains a **breadboard**, a red LED diode and a resistor are permanently included to always know if it is powered. If you are the first user of the kit, those components could not be already mounted on the breadboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the kit does not include a **breadboard** you will need to provide one yourself as this is a required element to work with the **SLab system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows the inside of a **SLab Kit** case that includes most of the optional components in this kit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Components](images/SLab_Kit_Inside.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Electronics Components Set** is a set of electronic components that is enough for all the proposed **SLab** experiments. It curretly includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A box to put inside all the components\n",
    "* 12 capacitors: $1nF$, $10nF$, $100nF$, $1\\mu F$, $10 \\mu F$ and $100 \\mu F$ (2 of each value)\n",
    "* 2x $10 k\\Omega$ trimpots\n",
    "* 2x MCP6002 Dual Opamp DIP8 Integrated Circuits\n",
    "* 2x BC547B NPN BJT transistors\n",
    "* 2x BC557B PNP BJT transistors\n",
    "* A BS170 NMOS transistor\n",
    "* A TP2104 PMOS transistor\n",
    "* 4x 1N4148 silicon diodes\n",
    "* 4x BAT42 Schottky diodes\n",
    "* 4x LED diodes: 2 red, 1 Green, 1 Blue\n",
    "* Some pieces of unifilar electric wire with different colors \n",

    "**A PC Computer**  \n",

    "## About the Hardware Board\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hardware Board** is the board that interfaces both with the host PC and the circuit we want to measure. This board need to have, at least, one USB connector with a **serial over USB** link for communication with the host PC, two [DAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter) outputs and four [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any boad that satify the previous requirements can be used as a **SLab Hardware Board** as long as it includes the needed **Firmware** to communicate with the PC. Although there are plans to suppor other boards, currently the best supported board is the [STM32F303RE Nucleo64 board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f303re.html). This is the board provided as part of the **SLab Kit**. You can see an image of the board below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Board Elements](images/board_elements.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will describe the most important elements on the board, respect to the SLab usage. If at some point you don't understand the explanations, don't worry, you don't need to know all about the board internals to use it. First thing is the connection to the **host PC**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **mini USB** connector, inside the pale blue box on the image, to connect to the host PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board features **LEDs**, shown iside the three red boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A communication bicolor red/green **LD1** LED on the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An user green **LD2** LED on the center right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A power red **LD3** LED on the center left.\n",
    "\n",
    "The communication **LD1** LED is a bicolor led that indicates the state of the debug link with the host PC. In normal operation it will light in **red** color. During the firmware upload operation it will link. It will only shine in solid **green** color after uploading a new firmware and until the next power-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LD2** LED is the user LED. Unfortunatelly the user LED is connected to the same microcontroller line of the **second DAC** output. That limits the **DAC** performance. From an user point of view, if you see light on this LED, that means that the **DAC2** output quatlity is starting to degrade. There is a documented method to remove this LED connection and access the full performance of **DAC2** but it requires some SMD desoldering.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you receive the **SLab Kit** it is possible for the board to come with a yellow sticker that contains a number or a number followed by an **\"X\"** letter. If your board contains this sticker and it includes the **\"X\"** letter, it means that the **DAC2** has been disconnected from the **LD2** LED as described in [this document](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Boards/Nucleo_F303RE_Zero/Board%2003%20-%20DAC2%20Improvement.ipynb). This means that **DAC2** will have improved operation but it also means that the user **LD2** cannot be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red **LD3** LED is the power LED. In indicates when the main CPU is powered. It should lit whenever the board is connected to a host PC. The board supports power negotiation with the PC. If the PC is not able to provide the power the board needs, this LED will turn off and the **SLab System** will be non operational.  \n",
    "It is interesting to note that the power **LD3** LED is connected to the internal $5V$ board supply rail that comes from the USB cable. This supply goes through a $3.3V$ LD39050 regulator before reaching the main MCU power rails. If you shortcircuit the breadboard power rails, no harm will be made to the board or the USB connection and, in fact, the **LD3** will continue to light-up as the $5V$ rail is unaffected when the $3.3V$ rail is shorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two big two column male **ST morpho** connectors, shown inside the yellow rectangles, on the sides of the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connector **CN7** on the left side\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connector **CN10** on the right side\n",
    "\n",
    "Those connectors give access to all the MCU pins and are used to interface with the circuit we will measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two buttons in the board, shown inside the green rectangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blue **User** button that implements the **Halt** function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Black **Reset** button to rese the board\n",
    "\n",
    "The user button implements the firmware **Halt** function, when you press this button the firmware stopts watever it is doing, returns an error code, and waits for new commands. This function is interesting if you, by mistake, send a too long to complete command to the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reset** button gives access to the main MCU reset line. If you press this button the MCU will reset and you will need to reconnect to the board. This button is useffull if the board hangs-up and is not recoverable by the **Halt** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To end this board description we have three jumper locations on the board, shown inside the orange boxes in the image. From top to bottom of the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CN2** ST-Link pair of jumpers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JP5** power selection jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JP6** $I_{DD}$ measurement jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "Jumpers are important because they are detachable from the board and, if you miss them, the board won't operate as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two top jumpers at **CN2** connect the main MCU debug port with the USB connector. You don't need those jumpers for normal operation of the board, but, if you remove them, you won't be able to upload any new firmware on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **JP5** jumper is a two position jumper that selects how the main MCU is powered. In order to power the MCU using the USB connector, it shall be on the right *U5V* position. If you put it on the left *E5V* position, you will need to power the MCU using the **E5V** pin at the **CN7** connector. If you take out the jimpler, the MCU won't be powered at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final **JP6** jumper connects the $3.3V$ rail with the main MCU $V_{DD}$ input. This jumper is meant to be substituted by an amperimeter to measure the current consumed by the MCU. You should never take off this jumper as it will remove the MCU power input."

    "* **+5V** is the the power rail, **E5V** or **U5V**, selected by **JP5** to power the main MCU\n",
    "* **+3V3** is the $3.3V$ rail before the **JP6** current measurement jumper\n",
    "* **VDD** is the $3.3V$ rail after the **JP6** current measurement jumper\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that transistor **T2** connects the **U5V** rail to the **JP5** jumper. This transistor will only turn when the **PWR_ENn** signal is enabled after the power negotiation with the PC succeeds. If your PC is not able to provide the required power, you can use an external power supply. In this case you would put the **JP5** jumper on the left *E5V* position and will use either the **E5V** or the **VIN** pins to power the main MCU. This option has the added benefit that, as the MCU is not powered by the host PC, the PC is somewhat more proteccted against user errors.  \n",
    "The [Nucleo64 Board Manual](http://localhost:8888/files/Boards/Nucleo_F303RE_Zero/PDF/STRM32%20Nucleo64%20User%20Manual.pdf) in the **Power supply and power selection** section gives a more in depth explanation about those options.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the schematic the MCU **VDD** $3.3V$ rail is provided by the **U4** regulator. That isolates somewhat the MCU supply from the USB power rail. That offers some protection if, for instance, you short the the $V_{DD}$ rails on the breadboard when doing some experiments.\n",
