    "Peridic signals are signals that repeat themselves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Periodic Signal](images\\Linear_AC_04\\periodic_signal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes the signal to repeat is the **period** and is usually associated to the $T$ letter. Formally, we can define the **period** $T$ of a signal $x(t)$ as the minimum $T$ value that satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t)=x(t+n \\cdot T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for any integer, positive or negative, $n$ number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define **frequency**, usually associated to the letter $f$, as the inverse of the period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f=\\frac{1}{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As time has **seconds** ($s$) units, frequency has $s^{-1}$ units.  \n",
    "As the frequency magnitude is used a lot, its unit has its on name **Hertz ($Hz$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Hz=\\frac{1}{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency is very important in sound because our ears are very sensitive to the frequency of the air pressure waves. In music, the [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note) are related to the frequency of the sound waves and, each time the frequency **doubles** we go up one [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, no signal is trully periodic as it should go from time $-\\infty$ to time $+\\infty$. In general we analyze **ideal** periodic signals because they are easier to deal with. After we understand them, we can deal with the fact that **real** signals are not trully periodic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency is important because it can be related to information. Let's consider a signal that can be sent to a far place to send information. Suppose also that it can have two levels and it has a period of $1 \\mu s$. Its frequency will be $1MHz$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Square Wave](images\\Linear_AC_04\\square_wave.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This signal, called a **square** signal, as is trully periodic, does not contain any information. It is always the same. But, if a system can transmit without degradation the above signal it can usually also transmit any similar non periodic signal as long as it does not change faster than the periodic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NP Square](images\\Linear_AC_04\\np_square.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This second signal contains information because each $\\mu s$ it can change its value and we don't know, in advance, the value it will take. As each $\\mu s$ we can have two equally probable outcomes, we get one [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) of information each $\\mu s$, so our information transmision capacity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1 bit}{1 \\mu s} = 10^6 \\frac{bit}{s} = 1 M \\frac{b}{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger the signal frequency a system can transmit, the bigger the information we can send.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any combination of bits is possible, so, in order to be capable to transmit $1Mb/s$ the system shall be able to transmit not only a $1MHz$ signal but also any signal with less than $1MHz$ down to constant DC as long as it has only two **high** and **low** levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the end, understanding the capacity of a system to transmit periodic signals is important for **sound** and, in general, for any information transmission system.\n",

Poles in the $i\\omega$ axis correspond to sinewaves whereas poles with **negative real** values correspond to decaying exponentials. Poles with **positive real** values correspond to unstable systems so we won't deal with them.\n",
