    "[Linearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity) is a mathematical property of some functions that can be exploited to ease the solution of those functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, a function of $n$ variables $f(x_1, x_2,...x_n)$ is linear if it satisfies two properties: **Additivity** and **Homogeneity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Additivity** property mean that you can add to the function variables and the net result is to add a evaluation of the function on those additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x_1+x'_1, x_2+x'_2,...x_n+x'_n) \n",
    "= f(x_1, x_2,...x_n)+  f(x'_1, x'_2,...x'_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Homogeneity** property mean that scalling all parameters by the same constant is equivalent to scale the function result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(k \\cdot x_1,k \\cdot x_2,...k \\cdot x_n) = k \\cdot f(x_1, x_2,...x_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To talk about **linear circuits** we need to define which functions should be linear in a circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "A circuit is **linear** if all its **voltages** and **currents** are linear function of their **independent sources**. If we have $n$ voltage sources and $m$ current sources, every voltage and current shall be a linear function with parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(V_1,V_2,....V_n,I_1,I_2,....I_m)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit components can also be linear. We define a **linear component** as a component where all the relationships betwee voltages and currents at their terminals are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a **resistor** is a linear component because its main equation that relates voltage and current, **Ohm's Law**, is a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_R = R \\cdot I_R \\qquad I_R = \\frac{1}{R} V_R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the inependent sources, whether they are **voltage** or **current** ones are not linear components as a constant value does not satisfy the **linear** properties.\n",
