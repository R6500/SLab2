You could also do the same in the non inverting amplifier adding a capacitor in parallel with the $R_1$ feedback resistor, but beware that this amplifier cannot attenuate no matter how low is $R_1$ or the combination of $R_1$ and whatever is in parallel, so you are limit to make fall the gain to 1 until you reach the **GBW** limit."
