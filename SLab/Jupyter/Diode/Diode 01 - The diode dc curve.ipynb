    "![fig 01](images\\D_01\\fig01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive terminal of the diode is called **anode (A)** and the negative terminal of the diode is called **cathode (K)**. Allowed current in the diode goes from anode (+) to cathode (-). The diode current uses the passive notation where current enters the positive terminal and exits the negative terminal. \n",

    "The following figure shows the ideal characteristic of the diode.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 02](images\\D_01\\fig02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see there are two possible states for the diode. In **ON** or conducting state, the voltage on the diode voltage is zero and requires the current to be positive. In the **OFF** or non conducting state, the diode current is zero and requires the voltage to be negative.\n",

    "## Real Diodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SLab projects we will deal with semiconductor junction diodes. This document doesn't pretend to be a semiconductor physics reference, but it is convenient to understand at least a basic explanation of the diode operation.\n",
    "Before dealing with semiconductors we will first talk about thermoionic vacuum diodes because they are easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 03](images\\D_01\\fig03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A vacuum diode has two metal surfaces **Anode (A)** and **Cathode (K)** separated some distance inside a glass tube where the air has been removed. The diode is not symmetrical because one surface, the anode is cold whereas the other, the cathode, is heated up to high temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature gives energy to the electrons in the cathode so they break loose of the metal and hover near its surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "We forward bias the diode if we apply a positive voltage difference between the anode and the cathode so that there is an electrical field from the anode (most positive) to the cathode (least positive).\n",
    "Electrons, as are **negative**, tend to move contrary to the electric field. As there are a lot of electrons hovering the cathode, they move up to the anode creating a current flow through the diode. By having removed the air inside the tube we prevent the moving electrons to collide with air particles. This device is called **unipolar** because there is only one kind of [charge carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carrier): the electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We reverse bias the diode if we apply a negative voltage difference between the anode and the cathode so that there is an electrical field from the cathode (most positive) to the anode (least positive).\n",
    "In this case, as the anode is cold, there are no electrons hovering this terminal and no current can flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the asymmetry of the heating of anode and cathode we obtain a device that only can conduct in one direction: from anode to cathode, and not in the other: from cathode to anode. So, in essence, we have a diode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a semiconductor diode we have a similar behavior. Semiconductor materials, like Silicon, are materials situated between conductors, that have a lot of charge carriers, and isolators, that have almost no charge carriers. What is interesting about semiconductors is that by adding some small amounts of other elements like **Boron** or **Phosphor**, we can control the charge of most of its carriers. That way we can have **N type** semiconductors where most of its carriers are negative electrons or **P type** semiconductors where most of its carriers are positive [holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we join together a **P type** and a **N type** semiconductor we obtain a **P-N junction**. The **P** material is called the **anode (A)** and the **N** material is called the **cathode (K)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 04](images\\D_01\\fig04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we forward bias the junction generating an electric field from anode to cathode, there are a lot of positive holes in the P region that can go to the N region following the field and a lot of electrons in the N region that can go to the P region going reverse to the field. From both charge movement contributions we get a forward current on the junction. The device is called **bipolar** because we have two different charge carriers: **negative electrons** and **positive holes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 05](images\\D_01\\fig05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reverse bias the junction generating an electric field from cathode to anode there is no current flow because there are no negative charges in the P region that can go to the right or positive charges in the N region that can go to the left. So, the diode does not conduct any current.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 06](images\\D_01\\fig06.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we have a device that can let the current go from the anode to the cathode but not from the cathode to the anode, so we have a diode.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 07](images\\D_01\\fig07.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point the theory of the semiconductor diode gets quit complex and is outside of this document objectives. If you dive in the solid state physics of the semiconductors you get that the voltage-current characteristic of a semiconductor diode can be modeled in DC with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_d(V_d) = I_s \\left( e^{V_d\\;/\\;\\eta V_T} - 1\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the current has an exponential dependence on the voltage. We can see also that at zero voltage the current is zero and at very negative voltages the -1 term dominates and the current is very close to $I_S$. That’s why $I_S$ is called the **Reverse Saturation Current**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse current is due to the fact that most charge carriers in the N region are electrons, but there are some holes. In the same way, most charge carriers in the P region are holes, but there are some electrons. So, there is a small quantity of electrons that can go from anode to cathode and a small amount of holes that can go from cathode to anode when the diode is in reverse operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't get fooled by the simplicity of the expression. Two parameters of the equation, $I_S$ and $V_T$, are temperature dependent. In fact the $V_T$ parameter is called thermal voltage because it is proportional to absolute temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_T = \\frac{k \\cdot T}{q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where k is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), T is the absolute temperature (in K) and q is the electron charge. At 27 ºC (300 K), $V_T$ is about $26mV$. $V_T$ is proportional to T so it increases with temperature. As $V_T$ is in the exponent denominator, it seems that $I_d$ seems should decrease when the temperature increases. Turns out, however, that $I_S$ also depends on temperature; and it increases with temperature at a faster rate that the $V_T$ effect on the exponential so the net effect is that $I_d$ increases with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change of $V_T$ for temperatures between 10 ºC and 40 ºC is only about a 5% of the value at 27 ºC, so, for first order calculations we consider $V_T$ to be a $26 mV$ constant at normal room temperatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a diode that follows the basic semiconductor models, the third parameter $\\eta$ called ideality factor is one. Unfortunately, a lot of diodes, including common silicon ones, don’t follow the basic model and require a correction by using a $\\eta$ value greater than one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Silicon is the most used semiconductor in electronics, so most normal diodes are made of this element. $I_S$ is usually in the nanoamp range, so, in order to obtain a current in the milliamp range, you need to have a six digit exponential. That requires an exponent of about 14. If $\\eta$ is close to 2, as is usual on some Silicon diodes, we need a $V_d$ value of 28 times $V_T$ or about $700 mV$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 08](images\\D_01\\fig08.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above figure shows a typical silicon diode curve. The behavior for negative voltages seems ideal. Current is not really zero, but in the nanoamp range, but for a lot of practical purposes, it is small enough. In the conducting region the voltage is not zero, but about $0.7V$ and slightly dependent on the diode current. \n",
    " \n",
    "Note that there are not two regions on the curve. It seems that way to us due to the exponential curve but, as we know, the exponential curve is the same at all scales, if we zoom in the vertical axis, we can see that now, in the tens of microamp range, the rise of current is noticeable at about $0.5V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 09](images\\D_01\\fig09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior can be deducted from the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left. I_d(V_d + \\Delta V_d)\\right|_{I_d>>I_s}\n",
    "\\approx I_S \\cdot e^{V_d \\; / \\; \\eta V_T} \\cdot e^{\\Delta V_d \\; / \\; \\eta V_T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Delta V_d$ is $120 mV$, \\eta is 2 and $V_T$ is $26 mV$, the diode current increases 10 times. So the diode current is increased 10 times for each $120 mV$ increase of voltage.\n",
    "That also means that for, voltages over $120 mV$, $I_d$ is at least 10 times the $I_S$ value and we can make the approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left. I_d(V_d) \\right|_{V_d>120mV}\n",
    "= I_s \\cdot e^{V_d \\; / \\; \\eta V_T}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If we further zoom in the current axis we can see that current is only zero at zero voltage and that it saturates to the constant saturation current $I_S$ value for negative currents.\n",

In Silicon diodes the dissipated power is converted to heat, but some diodes that use other semiconductor materials can dissipate part of the power as light. That is the case of the **Light Emitting Diodes** (LED). The shorter the wavelength of the LED, the more energy the photons carry and the higher the threshold of the device is.\n",
