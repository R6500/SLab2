# SLab2

New version of the **SLab** system

The SLab system is a low cost electronics Lab aimed to teaching electronics

It uses a cheap demostration board to interface with a circuit under test

User interface is built around **Jupyter Notebooks** that contain **Python** Code

In order to use the software you need to have a working Python 3 system with Jupyter installed

Copy all the files and folders inside a main *"SLab"* folder

Jupyter shall start on the *"Jupyter"* folder

Before starting Jupyter, the **PHYTHONPATH** variable should point to the *"Code"* folder

The *"Anaconda_SLab_Jupyter.bat"* in the *"Scripts"* folder provides one example for Windows that works for an **Anaconda** installation. 

All the files are provided in a zip file *"SLab2 (version).zip"* file to ease downloading.
