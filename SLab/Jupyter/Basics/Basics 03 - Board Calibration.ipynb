    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are supposed to have a working **Hardware Board**. And you should know that it is working. Now we will try to guarantee that we can get good measurements from the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a measurement system the most important feature is to obtain repetitive measurements. That is, every time we measure the same real magnitude, we should get the same reading. Having a good read value is not as important as having always the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a measurement system that for real voltage values between 0V and 3V gives voltage readings between 0.2V and 2.2V like in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Calibration Curve](images\\Basics_03\\Calibration_Curve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the real voltage is 1V, the read value will be 1,35V. That's a big error but it is not a measurement problem. As long as we always get the same input to output relationship, we can always use the curve to deduce the real value from any measured value. That's why it is called a **calibration curve**. Using this curve we can calibrate our readings to reconstruct the real values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we never get exactly the same values when we measure the same magnitudes. The following figure shows a more real case where there is some uncertainty to the measurement values. We have superposed different colors for different measurements using the instruments. The uncertainty from one measurement to the next could be due to noise or drifts in the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Uncertainty](images\\Basics_03\\Uncertainty.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty is what limits the precision we can get from the instrument as the systematic measurement to real value relationship can always be calibrated.\n",
    "In general, it is best to have a nonlinear low uncertainty instrument than a linear high uncertainty instrument as uncertainty cannot be calibrated. That way, the following will be a bad instrument because, although it is linear, the response has a lot of random content.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bad Instrument](images\\Basics_03\\Bad_Instrument.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a laboratory setup we usually deal with systematic errors with calibration and we deal with uncertainty errors with the averaging of several measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we will obtain the calibration curves for the **ADCs** and **DACs** so that we correct the systematic errors in the measurements of our circuits."

    "## Ratiometric measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SLab system we use DACs to set voltages and ADCs to measure voltages. Both ADCs and DACs are ratiometric devices. That means that the input to a DAC and the output of an ADC is given as a unitless ratio to a reference voltage. Although it is not always true, most microcontroller boards use its Vdd voltage as the reference. The SLab system holds the both the value of the supply Vdd voltage and the Vref reference voltage for the ADCs and DACs although they are usually similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the ADC and DAC ratios as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad ratio = \\frac{Voltage}{Vref}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **Vref** is the reference voltage for the **ADCs** and **DACs** that is usually similar or equal to the supply voltage **Vdd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a n bit DAC, the ratio is set as a DACin number from $0$ to $2^{n-1}$ respect to $2^n$. So, the voltage $V_{DAC}$ generated by a DAC is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad V_{DAC}=V_{Ref} \\cdot DAC_{ratio} = \n",
    "V_{Ref} \\frac{DAC_{in}}{2^n} \\qquad 0 \\leq DAC_{in} < 2^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F303RE board, for instance, includes two 12 bit DACs. Input on those DACs can be from 0 to 4095, so the maximum output voltage value will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad V_{DACmax} = V_{ref}\\frac{2^{12}-1}{2^{12}}=3.3V\\frac{4095}{4096}=3.299V$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar way, in a n bit ADC, the measured voltage VADC is provided as a ratio against the Vref reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad ratio_{max} = \\frac{2^{12}-1}{2^{12}} = 0,9998$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice it is so close to one that the SLab commands set this maximum value when we request an impossible ratio of 1.0."

    "## Slab Calibration Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration in the SLab system uses three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vref voltage (Reference for ADCs and DACs)\n",
    "* Ratiometric DAC curves   CalDACi(x)\n",
    "* Ratiometric ADC curves   CalADCi(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each ADC number i, from 1 to 4, it shall hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad \\frac{Measured Voltage}{Vref}=CalADC_i \\left( \\frac{RealVoltage}{V_{Ref}} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the calibration curve of the ADCs indicates the ratiometric value we measure on the ADC when we set each possible real ratiometric value at the input of the ADC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar way, for each DAC number **i**, it shall hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad \\frac{Real Voltage}{Vref}=CalDAC_i \\left( \\frac{SetVoltage}{V_{Ref}} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the calibration curves for the DACs indicates the ratiometric real value set for each intended ratio we set the DAC to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "All operations on the DACs and ADCs use the three calibration elements so that we always work with the real values. Slab uses Vref and CalADCi(x) to obtain real values for measured ADC values and uses Vref and CalDACi(x) to set the DAC inputs from the intended real value to set at the DAC outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the calibration system to operate correctly we need to guarantee two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That calibration is **always the same**. That is, each time the buffer circuit or the hardware board changes we need to recalibrate. It is also advisable to calibrate from time to time to correct from temporal deviations. Ideally you should calibrate at the start of each measurement session but that is not always practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* That calibration curves are **monotonous**. That is, that you can invert the curves to obtain real voltages from measured voltages in ADCs and set voltages from real voltages in DACs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As DACs and ADCs are quite linear, the SLab system currently uses calibration curves with only 9 points. Data is linear interpolated between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware boards are not guaranteed to contain any reliable voltage reference, so we will need a measurement instrument capable of reading voltages to perform the calibration. A hand held multimeter usually will do. From this point we will call this instrument a **Voltage Metter** (VM).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to calibrate a system is to perform a **chain of calibrations**. First, we calibrate one instrument, and then we use the measurements from that instrument to calibrate other instruments. Each calibrated instrument can be used to calibrate any uncalibrated instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration in our case is performed in **three stages**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **first stage** we calibrate the first DAC, **DAC1** and all ADCs against an external **VM**. We also obtain the **Vref** and **Vdd** values in this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **second stage** we calibrate the other DACs (only DAC2 on the **F303 board** for instance) against the previously calibrated ADCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **third stage** we check the calibration. This stage is optional, because the calibration is complete at the end of the second stage. But verifying the calibration won't hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, calibration is performed on all available channels. Some **SLab** boards feature a large number of ADC channels and, perhaps, you don't need to calibrate all the channels. In general, for most **SLab** experiments, you only need to use a maximum of four **ADC** channels. We will provide code in this notebook for two options: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Full calibration of all ADCs\n",
    "* Calibration of only 4 ADCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the option that suits your needs. Of course, you can change the number of calibrated channels to any other number as long as the number of ADCs is bigger or equal that the number of available DACs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous **SLab** versions, there was a four stage calibration procedure. This method is still available, but only for backward compatibility. This document only describes the new **three stage** calibration method."

We will use a **Voltage Metter** (VM) instrument capable of measuring voltages to perform this calibration stage. A **handheld multimeter** will do.
