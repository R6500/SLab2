    "\n",
    "We initially expected the BJT to work as two diodes: one for the **BE** junction and another for the **BC** junction. Now we know that when one junction is forward biased and the other is reverse biased, the reverse biased junction starts conducting current.\n",

    "The polarity of the currents on the base $I_B$, collector $I_C$ and emitter $I_E$ have been defined so that they are all positive in the transistor **Forward Active** region of operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes two diodes. The current of the diodes follow the traditional exponential equations and the saturation current of both diodes are different. On each diode its current depends on the voltage at the junction (from P to N) and the Thermal Voltage $V_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_F=I_{ES}\\left( e^{V_{BE}/V_T}-1\\right) \\qquad I_R=I_{CS}\\left( e^{V_{BC}/V_T}-1\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the model of the BJT if it behaved like two diodes. As we know, having one junction forward biased generates current on the other junction. That is modeled with two controlled current sources $\\alpha_F I_F$ and $\\alpha_R I_R$ that are proportional to the previously defined diode currents. Both $\\alpha_F$ and $\\alpha_R$ are constant and lower than one. In the case of $\\alpha_F$, it is usually very close to one. The value of $\\alpha_R$ is usually much lower.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The injection model is a good model because is closely related to the internal transistor physics, but from a circuit point of view it is not perfect: It includes a very complex base node that joins all four internal components and includes one parameter, $\\alpha_F$, that is very close to one but that cannot be approximated to one because that will imply a zero base current in the **Forward Active** region."

    "We have used the simple model to solve several circuits and check the theoretical result against measurements. It is interesting to note that the deviation of the calculations from the measurements depends more on the current gain uncertainty than on the use of a simple model. Using the full transport model won't give us much better results if we are not sure of the exact current gain of the BJT we are measuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have developed both the transport and the simple models for the **PNP** sibling of the **NPN** transistor. We see that the models are the same as in the NPN case if we reverse voltage and current polarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simple Model is the foundation for solving, at DC, any circuit that includes BJTs. As the model assumes that the $V_{BE}$ voltage is constant in the Forward Active region, it will give gross errors when the circuit operation depends on the $V_{BE}$ variation. This is especially true in high gain amplifiers, so we will need to develop a small signal model for the BJT as we did previously for the diode."
