    "The **operational amplifier**, opamp for short, is a device that amplifies the **voltage difference** Vd between two input nodes: A positive (+) or **non inverting input** (nii) and a negative (-) or **inverting input** (ii). The output of the amplifier Vo is **A** times the input voltage difference.\n",
    "The following figure shows the operational amplifier symbol together with the zero order basic model that implements the above explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 01](images\\L_OA_01\\fig01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model shows that the output node is forced, by a dependent voltage source, to a voltage that is proportional to the Vd voltage between the inputs. \n",
    "This is a model, an idealization of what the opamp should be. We will see later that real opamps fail to operate always as this model.\n",
    "Observe that the input terminals are not connected to anything. The described model supposes that that the current entering the opamp through its input terminals is zero.\n",
    "Observe also that the basic model includes a node, the ground node, which is not included in the opamp symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the above model we can get the output of the opamp as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_O = A \\cdot V_d = A\\left(V_{(+)}-V_{(-)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater the A value, the better. An ideal opamp will operate just like the above model with an infinite A gain. So it will satisfy:\n",

    "If the two included opamps were ideal, we wouldn’t need any more information as they would just behave as the model says. If they were not ideal but they worked as the zero order model with a finite gain, we would only need the gain A value. The less ideal a component is, the more information we need about it to know how it really operates.\n",

A particular opamp can have a different value, as low as the minimum limit of 88 dB. Observe that there is no maximum value. It is unbound. That means that you can get any gain over 88 dB. \n",
