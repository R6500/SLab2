As the resistor is a **linear** component, any circuit with only these three kinds of components is **linear**. Remember that the independent supplies are not linear. They are the **input** variables of our circuit. To put it in mathematical terms, all the components, **except the sources**, define the linear function and **the sources** are the function's inputs.\n",

    "In this chapter we will introduce the **controlled sources** They are like the independent souces but they are not **independent** because the **voltage** or **current** they force on the circuit depend on a **voltage** or **current** circuit variable. Note that, as they are not **independent**, they are not inputs to our circuit, they are part of the circuit's function like the resistors. To differentiate them from the **independent** supplies we will draw them as a rhomb shape.\n",
