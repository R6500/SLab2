    "To summarize the above explanations this section indicates the needed steps to analyze a circuit that includes one or several diodes using the small signal model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step One**\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain the quiescent state of the circuit. In particular it is vital to obtain the quiescent current on all diodes. In order to solve the circuit we will use the constant voltage model for the diodes. Remember that we need to make hypothesis on the combination of states of all diodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quiescent circuit all constant voltage and current sources will have its own value and time dependent sources will have its mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step Two**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the dynamic resistance for all the diodes. Diodes in **OFF** state have an infinite dynamic resistance (open circuit). Diodes in **ON** state have a dynamic resistance defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad r_d = \\frac{\\eta V_T}{I_{dQ}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**StepThree**\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain the incremental circuit. This circuit is obtained substituting all components by their incremental equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For voltage or current sources they have their value with the quiescent value subtracted. That means that constant sources are zero in the incremental circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For linear components, like resistors, they do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For diodes, they are substituted by their dynamic resistances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step Four**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the incremental circuit to obtain the incremental variables.\n",
    "The amplitude of any time dependent signal can always be obtained from the incremental variables.\n",
    "If you need to obtain a global circuit variable, you can obtain it using superposition:\n",

    "To end this document, we will analyze the diode modulator shown on the following figure.\n",

    "![fig 09](images\\D_03\\fig09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A modulator is a circuit that modulates a carrier signal, usually a constant frequency sine wave, with another lower frequency time variant signal that carries some information. In our case the circuit performs [amplitude modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation). It will modulate a carrier $200 Hz$ sine wave with a $2 Hz$ square wave. The following example shows one example of a sine carrier modulated in amplitude with a square wave although the frequency ratio is 1 to 10 not 1 to 100 like in our case. If it were represented with a 1 to 100 ratio it wouldn't be possible to scale the image so that both the carrier and the modulating signals are easy recognizable.\n",

    "The circuit uses the non linearity of the diode to modulate the carrier generated on **DAC1** with the square signal generated on **DAC2**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **DAC1** output generates a $200 Hz sine wave with minimum at $2 V$ and maximum at $2.5$ V so the peak to peak voltage is $0.5 V$ and the amplitude $0.25 V$.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The **DAC2** output generates a square wave. That means that it alternates two output values that in our case will be $2V$ and $3V$. For each of those two values, we have a different quiescent point for the diode. \n",
    "\n",
    "The capacitor impedance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z_{C1} = \\frac{1}{j \\cdot 2 \\pi f \\cdot C_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the carrier $200 Hz$ frequency it is quite low, but at the $2 Hz$ modulating signal it is high enough for the capacitor to be modeled as an open circuit.\n",

    "Consider a constant voltage silicon diode model with $V_\\gamma = 0.7V$ and suppose that $C_1$ current is zero for those calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the small signal model for the diode for the two cases, we can obtain the incremental circuit. In the incremental circuit, **D1** is substituted by its dynamic resistance $r_d$. The **DAC2** source voltage is zero. That means that $R_2$ is parallel with $r_d$. As $r_d$ is always much lower, $R_2$ can be neglected. **DAC1** source is substituted by its incremental value:\n",

    "You can expect some discrepancies between the calculations and the measurements. Absolute amplitudes can be off up to about a factor of two although relative amplitudes relationship should agree better.\n",

    "The small signal method uses a rough model of the diode around a quiescent point and we have added also some simplifications to the calculations like neglecting $R_2$ in the incremental circuit and considering $C_1$ open circuit in the $r_d$ calculations. Moreover, the components, especially capacitor $C_1$ have some tolerance on its real value respect to its nominal value. So, we cannot expect exact results from the calculations.\n",

    "This project has shown the small signal calculation method for the diode. This method is crucial to understand the operation of other non linear devices like the bipolar and field effect transistors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last exercise we have calculated the response of a diode modulator that takes profit of the non linear diode behavior to modulate a carrier signal with a square wave. Building modulators is, in fact, a typical RF application for diodes. Although the measurements would not perfectly agree with the calculations, being able to roughly predict the operation of the circuit gives us a great insight on how it is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant voltage diode model and the small signal diode models are the two main models we will use later for hand calculation of most diode circuits. There will be, however, some special cases where both models are not enough and we will need to use the full exponential model. That should serve to remind us that an important part in engineering is being able to select the model best suited to a problem. This is the model that most eases the calculations while also adds a reasonable error to the values it predict."
